# Player versus AI Cows and Bulls Game

A Python implementation of the classic game "Bulls and Cows" that allows you to play against an AI. In this game, you and the AI try to guess each other's secret 4-digit numbers with the digits all being unique. After each guess, the number of "bulls" and "cows" is reported back. A "bull" is a correct digit in the correct position, and a "cow" is a correct digit in the wrong position.
